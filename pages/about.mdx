# About

This is a personal wiki created with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) to document and organize knowledge related to software development and web development.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this wiki is to help me continuously learn and retain information in these fields. By documenting what I learn, I can refer back to it later and build on it, avoiding the need to re-learn things I've already studied. Additionally, the act of organizing and writing down knowledge can help me better understand and remember it.

## Contents

The wiki covers a variety of topics related to software and web development, including:

- Programming languages
- Frameworks
- Front-end technologies
- Back-end technologies
- Development tools
- Web development concepts such as responsive design, SEO, and web performance
- Best practices such as testing, debugging, and documentation

## Usage

The wiki is organized into pages and sub-pages, with a table of contents to help navigate between them. Each page covers a specific topic, with links to related pages and external resources where applicable. I aim to update the wiki regularly as I learn new things, and to revisit and revise existing pages as needed.

## Contribution

While this is a personal wiki, I welcome feedback and suggestions from others in the software and web development community. If you have a suggestion for a topic I should cover or a correction to make, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/neumand/dev-docs). However, please note that this is a personal project and I may not be able to accept all contributions.
